    "In the previous week you used the lake problem as a means of getting aquinted with the workbench. In this assignment we will continue with the lake problem, focussing explicitly on using it for open exploration. You can use the second part of [this tutoria]https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indepth_tutorial/open-exploration.html) for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is paramount that you are using the lake problem with 100 decision variables, rather than the one found on the website with the seperate anthropogenic release decision**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Apply sensitivity analysis\n",
    "There is substantial support in the ema_workbench for global sensitivity. For this, the workbench relies on [SALib](https://salib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and feature scoring which is a machine learning alternative for global sensitivity analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. As a start, generate a release policy without any release *(hint: use a Policy instance)*\n",
    "2. use sobol sampling with the no release policy, and set n to 100.000\n",
    "3. calculate sobol indices for max_P and reliability based on 100, 1000, 10.000, and 100.000 experiment. *(hint: sobol is a deterministic sequence, so you can slice results from the data generated in stap 2)*"
